# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** The server is setup with Fedora and ready to rumble for the next 100 days. Completed ex33 from Learning Python the Hard Way (LPTHW). 

**Thoughts:** Not too much progress today - I have forgotten a lot of the python syntax. I need to skim through the earlier chapters and take another crash course in Git as well. Tomorrow will be better.

### Day 1: August 24, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed exercises 36 and 38 from LPTHW. 

**Thoughts:** Learning about lists and how to use them. 

**Link to work:** [ex35.py](https://github.com/mastersontj/LPTHW/blob/master/ex35.py) and [ex38.py](https://github.com/mastersontj/LPTHW/blob/master/ex38.py) 



### Day 2: August 25, 2020

**Today's Progress:** Completed exercises 39 from LPTHW. 

**Thoughts:** Learning about dicts and where to use them. It was an interesting lesson but I felt very distracted during the course of the hour. More than likely, I'll end up revisiting this topic tomorrow.
