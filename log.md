# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 23, 2020

**Today's Progress:** The server is setup with Fedora and ready to rumble for the next 100 days. Completed ex33 from Learning Python the Hard Way (LPTHW). 

**Thoughts:** Not too much progress today - I have forgotten a lot of the python syntax. I need to skim through the earlier chapters and take another crash course in Git as well. Tomorrow will be better.
